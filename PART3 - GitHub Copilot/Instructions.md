# Project - Simple TODO App

Take a look at the project todo-app in this section. Can you understand the codebase? Yes... it was generated by AI. :)

I have introduced a nasty bug - tasks can be completed, but not deleted.

## Tasks (you could do these by yourself, but experiment with Copilot)

- Find the bug in the code
- Fix the bug
- New feature: reject new tasks that only contain numbers (e.g. "235", "888327"...)
- New feature: add 3 views/filters for the TODO tasks: "Not Done", "Completed", "All". A user should be able to switch between all 3 filters
- Add simple unit tests to the project
