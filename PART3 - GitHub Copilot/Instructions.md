Recommended: copy the todo-app directory into a separate workspace before working on it (AI sometimes has trouble navigating directory structure if the project is not in the root directory)

# Project - Simple TODO App

Take a look at the project todo-app in this section. Can you understand the codebase? The project includes a README.md with basic documentation about the stack and how to run it. Try it out with liveserver!

If you're wondering... Yes, it was generated with AI! :)

There is a nasty bug - tasks can be completed, but not deleted.

## Tasks (you could do these by yourself, but experiment with Github Copilot)

- Find the bug in the code
- Fix the bug
- New feature: reject new tasks that only contain numbers (e.g. "235", "888327"...)
- New feature: add 3 views/filters for the TODO tasks: "Not Done", "Completed", "All". A user should be able to switch between all 3 filters
- Add simple unit tests to the project
- New feature: add multiple columns for tickets, create tickets in the first column by default but allow dragging tickets between columns
- New feature: let the tickets have background colors choosable from a small selection
